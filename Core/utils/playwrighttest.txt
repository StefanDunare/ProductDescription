More Information Unblock content Accept required service and unblock content Sounding Bell Hora Detailed information Dial The dial of the Bell Hora in blue has a fine sunburst finish that creates a soft, iridescent light effect. The geometry of the dial features a spiral-shaped design. Together with the additional numerals 13–24 arranged in a circle, the dial provides an intuitive overview of the entire course of the day. The bell symbol in the lower half of the dial refers to the otherwise unseen feature of this timepiece: The chiming of the bell on the hour. Case The stainless steel case is 43 mm in diameter, water-resistant up to 5 bar, and fitted with a sapphire glass over the dial that is domed on one side. A pusher is located above the crown at 2 o’clock that can be used to switch the chiming of the Bell Hora on or off. The movement can be easily viewed through the fourfold screwed glass exhibition back as it performs its high-precision task. Movement The MS Bell automatic movement ticks inside the Bell Hora and is fitted with the chiming module developed by MeisterSinger. The movement is based on the Swiss Sellita SW200, which is specially modified for MeisterSinger’s single-hand watches. Over a 60-minute period, it gathers the energy it requires to produce a precise, well-dosed strike against the sound fork located behind the dial. During the quiet hours, the mechanism can be disengaged by pressing the pusher located above the crown. When the pusher is pulled out, a black mark on it indicates that the watch will remain silent for the upcoming hours. The rotor provides the watch with a power reserve of 38 hours. Features With a melodious “sonnerie au passage” on the hour, the Bell Hora is reviving an almost forgotten complication. It always chimes just once to tell its wearer that a new hour has begun. The Bell Hora has received the Red Dot Design Award for its overall design concept. The leather straps come with a high-quality doublefolding clasp. Reading a single-hand watch Each line in the outer circle of MeisterSinger’s single-hand watches stands for exactly 5 minutes. The hand is therefore both an hour hand and a minute hand. For example, if the hand points to the fifth stroke after ten, the time is 10:25.The line hierarchy typical of MeisterSinger single-hand watches additionally divides the time display into half and quarter hours, thus making it easier to read off the time accurately.

TAG:DIV | CONTENT: MeisterSinger single-hand watches combine award-winning design from Germany with the quality of Swiss watchmaking. Mechanical wristwatches with one hand let us experience time in a stress-free and more relaxed way – they give us a feeling of deceleration. At the same time, mechanical single-hand watches with their historical background take us back to the beginnings of time measurement. From the sundial to the first mechanical watches of the Middle Ages to the first portable watches, they all showed the time with only one hand – the hour hand. Single-hand watches from MeisterSinger take up this original principle again. In combination with the internationally award-winning product design, unique timepieces are created that teach us a more relaxed approach to time. A MeisterSinger single-hand watch gives us the feeling of being given time as a gift.

Mechanical wristwatches with one hand let us experience time in a stress-free and more relaxed way – they give us a feeling of deceleration. At the same time, mechanical single-hand watches with their historical background take us back to the beginnings of time measurement. From the sundial to the first mechanical watches of the Middle Ages to the first portable watches, they all showed the time with only one hand – the hour hand. Single-hand watches from MeisterSinger take up this original principle again. In combination with the internationally award-winning product design, unique timepieces are created that teach us a more relaxed approach to time. A MeisterSinger single-hand watch gives us the feeling of being given time as a gift.
